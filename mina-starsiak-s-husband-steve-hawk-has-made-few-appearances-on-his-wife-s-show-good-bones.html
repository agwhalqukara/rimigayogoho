He is best known as the husband of <strong>Mina Starsiak Hawk</strong>. Mina is a tv personality who appears on HGTV's reality shows, <i>Good Bones, A Very Brady Renovation, and Rock the Block</i>.</p><p>Stephen (Steve) Hawk was born on <i>November 2, 1981,</i> in the United States. His father was <strong>Richard Hawk</strong>, while his mother was <strong>Sally Hawk</strong>. Steve has a brother named, <strong>Christopher Hawk</strong>, while his sister, <strong>Stefanie</strong> died in early 2020. Talking about his education, Hawk attended Indiana University Bloomington. He is not related to the skateboarder, <strong>Tony Hawk</strong>.</p><h2>Four Years of Marriage with Wife</h2><p>Steve and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Mina Starsiak</strong></a> exchanged their wedding vows on <i>June 11, 2016,</i> in Indianapolis, Indiana. The reception party took place at the city's 1899 building. Further, the couple served 400 donuts to guests instead of the wedding cake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/StvMin-1608471692645.jpg><p>The couple married after three years of relationship. Steve had proposed to his future wife in 2015 sending her on a scavenger hunt. Afterward, he popped the question on the 50-yard-line of the Indianapolis Colts' training field.</p><h2>Steve made "Not-So-Good" First Impression</h2><p>It was Mina who first noticed Steve on social media. They <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>connected</strong></a> through mutual friends on Facebook. Soon, they went out on a group date to see a baseball game. Although Mina found Steve incredibly handsome, the tattooed-hunk paid no attention to her. Mina recalls the moment: <i>"He ignored me all night. He let his friends hit on me."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/stmn-1608471970214.jpg><p>Nevertheless, Mina decided to give him a second chance. She got his number and texted: <i>"We're going to try this again tomorrow—you get one more shot."</i> The pair struggled in the initial phase of their relationship, broke up for a while but later got back together. This way, Steve nearly blew up the chance to marry that right person.</p><h2>Steve and Mina's Kids</h2><p>After two years of marriage, Steve and his spouse welcomed their first child, a son named, <strong>Jack Richard Hawk</strong> on <i>August 9, 2018</i>. However, Mina struggled to get pregnant a second time. She tried acupuncture and fertility bracelet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/steveson-1608472265045.jpg><p>Further, Mina shared her IVF journey on Good Bones and regularly updated her fans about the pregnancy. The home renovator revealed during that time she felt a lot of anxiety.</p><p>Luckily, the couple's second child, daughter, <strong>Charlotte Drew Hawk</strong> was born on <i>September 16, 2020</i>. Her middle name Drew was picked to honor one of Steve's late friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/stevedaughter-1608472353309.jpg><p>At present, the family of four is happy and healthy. Before their two kids, Hawk and Starsiak parented their niece, <strong>Julie</strong> as her foster parents.</p><h2>Who is Mina Starsiak? The Star of HGTV's Good Bones</h2><p>Steve's other half is a realtor, renovator, and tv star who first gained wide popularity after appearing on HGTV's show, <i>Good Bones</i>. In the show, she appears alongside her mother, <strong>Karen E. Laine,</strong> and other family members. She has been featured on HGTV's magazine cover with <a href=#><strong>David Bromstad</strong></a>.</p><p>Further, Steve has also made numerous appearances on Good Bones helping his wife on the renovation. Sometimes he can be seen helping the crew as well. The show's sixth season will premiere in the summer of 2021.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>There is no exact information about Steve's net worth and earnings. He is a celebrity husband but Hawk has a decent professional career. As mentioned, Steve is an advertising consultant at Co-Star Group. Besides, he also helps Mina on her show renovating houses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/20/Minstv-1608473325035.jpg><p>On the other hand, Hawk's wife, Mina Starsiak has an estimated net worth of <strong>$1 million</strong>.
