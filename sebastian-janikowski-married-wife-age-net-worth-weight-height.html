On September 12, Sebastian tied the record of the NFL established by Tom Dempsey in 1970 as well as Jason Elam in 1998 after scoring for 63 yards in the rainy first half against the Denver Broncos.</span></p><p><span>Two months later (November 27, 2011), he broke the team record for most goals in a single game after scoring 6 goals – 40, 47, 42, 19, 37 and 44 yards in the game against the Chicago Bears.&nbsp;By the 2017 season, he had played a total of 268 games with the raider for which he held the record for most games played.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s no secret that athletes especially NFL players smile very well in the bank from time to time, some of us who don’t play sports wish we did.&nbsp;I mean who wouldn’t want to live the good life.&nbsp;For Sebastian, although he didn’t start out with much when it came to his family, his skills definitely paved the way for him in terms of fame and fortune.&nbsp;Over the years, his income has also grown exponentially as his estimated net worth currently sits at $14 million, a truly impressive figure.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life: married, wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>As with most of the NFL’s top players, their private lives are usually deeply hidden from the public, which we haven’t yet figured out, but it’s their personal lives, it’s assumed they have the right to decide whether whether or not they want to make certain aspects of their lives public.</span></p><p><span>With Sebastian, the story is similar to Little is known about his relationship, but among other things it is known that he is a married man and his wife’s name is Lori Janikowski.&nbsp;According to reports, he and Lori started dating in 2003 and got married in 2008. Together, the couple have two adorable daughters who are twins.&nbsp;Their names are Mila Janikowski and Vi Janikowski.&nbsp;Interestingly, the couple are expecting their third child who is also a girl.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Weight and height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Contact sports such as American football is not for the timid or the unfit, it is a sport that requires a certain size and bulk if one does well as a player, as it can certainly get messy on the playing field. For Sebastian, he is well equipped for the demanding nature of the sport as he has the right body type (with a height of 6.2m and a weight of 240lbs) to favorably face equally tough opponents. .</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirlZeutMDImqVmopGjtqy71qyiomWdlr%2BztcSdZLChlpp6orPEZqWerF2svLPAx2aunqGXncFutMSinqGsXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsebastian-janikowski-married-wife-age-net-worth-weight-height.html&text=Sebastian%20Janikowski%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Weight%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsebastian-janikowski-married-wife-age-net-worth-weight-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsebastian-janikowski-married-wife-age-net-worth-weight-height.html&title=Sebastian%20Janikowski%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Weight%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsebastian-janikowski-married-wife-age-net-worth-weight-height.html&title=Sebastian%20Janikowski%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Weight%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsebastian-janikowski-married-wife-age-net-worth-weight-height.html&title=Sebastian%20Janikowski%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Weight%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsebastian-janikowski-married-wife-age-net-worth-weight-height.html&description=Sebastian%20Janikowski%20Married%2c%20Wife%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Weight%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-football-scientist-s-do-not-draft-list-tua-tagovailoa-christian-watson-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Football Scientists Do Not Draft list: Tua Tagovailoa, Christian Watson and more">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./keeping-corn-snakes-as-pets-the-best-choice-for-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keeping Corn Snakes as Pets: The Best Choice for You?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
