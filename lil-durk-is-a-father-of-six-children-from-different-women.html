The Chicago-born rapper once revealed that he would love to father at least ten children, and he is more than halfway to his desired goal as a father.</strong></p><p>Born Durk Derrick Banks on October 19, 1992, the 31 year-old musician grew up without a father as his dad, Dontay Banks Sr., who is currently serving two life sentences, was incarcerated when he was only 7 months old. That put a lot of responsibilities on his shoulders from a young age, and even more so when he became a father for the first time when he was just a teenager. The rapper has since added five more kids to his brood, albeit with different women, and this is what we know about his children.</p><h2><strong>Angelo Banks Was Born When His Father Was Just A Teenager</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> November 29, 2011</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 12 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nicole Covone</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li></ul><p>As previously indicated, Lil Dirk was just a 17-year-old teenager when he became a father for the first time. Angelo Banks is the name of that child he had more than a decade ago. Angelo was born on November 29, 2011, in Chicago, Illinois, United States.</p><p>His birth sign is Sagittarius, and he is currently 12 years old. While he is undoubtedly an American citizen by birth and parental heritage, Angelo’s ethnic identity is not as clear-cut as his national identity.</p><p>One would be hard-pressed to argue against the fact that he is predominantly of the African American ethnic group, but it would also be negligent to ignore his European ancestry of Italian from his mother’s side.</p><p>Speaking of mothers, Angelo’s father had him as a result of his relatively long-term relationship with Italian American beauty Nicole Covone. Angelo’s mother was born to Italian parents on April 25, 1990, in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Not much is known about members of her birth family except for her mother, Dinah Covone, who died in 2012.</p><h3><strong>Angelo’s Parents May Have Been High School Sweethearts</strong></h3><p>A few outlets have theorized that Angelo’s parents were high school sweethearts, but there has been no solid proof to back up that theory. We can confirm, though, that the celebrity child’s parents officially began dating in 2008, quite a while before Lil Durk became the music sensation that he is today.</p><p>It is also significant to point out that Angelo’s mother is more than two years older than his father, but the now-former couple never let something as trivial as age difference come in between them. They had Angelo three years into their relationship but ended that relationship about five years after they started dating following the birth of Angelo’s sister Bella.</p><p>The 12 year-old’s parents have both moved on with their lives and have shared custody of the two children they had together. While details of Lil Durk’s colorful relationship history can be found online, Angelo’s mum has, nonetheless, kept a low profile concerning the details of her love life, leaving us with no way of knowing who she might be romantically involved with at the moment.</p><h3><strong>Angelo Banks Has Had His Fair Share Of The Spotlight</strong></h3><p>Between having his own Instagram page where he posts pictures of himself and family members, his parents’ desire to show him off on their social media pages, and being the oldest child of one of the hottest hip-hop acts in the United States today, Angelo Banks knows all about being in the spotlight.</p><p>It is important, though, to establish the fact that his dad Lil Durk did not have as big of a musical profile as he currently does when Angelo was born. Despite his significant online presence, details of the celebrity child’s formal educational background have yet to become public knowledge.</p><p>However, one could be persuaded to agree that, given his age and family background, he is currently in the process of obtaining the required academic qualifications from some of the best schools in the United States.</p><h2><strong>Bella Banks Is Lil Durk’s Second Child With Nicole Covone</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 19, 2013</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 10 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nicole Covone</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li></ul><p>Bella Banks was born on July 19, 2013, and is currently 10 years old. While she was born in the United States, we have yet to ascertain the exact place of her birth in the North American country. Bella was born with the birth sign of Cancer and is an American citizen not just by birth but as a result of her parental heritage.</p><p>Bella is the youngest of the two children African American rapper Lil Durk had with his Italian-American ex-girlfriend Nicole Covone. Having an Italian American mother also means that Bella has Italian ancestry through her mother.</p><p>Bella is almost two years younger than her older brother Angelo but the not-so-negligible age difference between the siblings has not prevented them from forming a close bond which has been revealed through their respective social media profiles.</p><p>Contrary to several assertions, Bella’s parents were never married, but they carried on a five-year relationship that eventually ended a few months after the birth of Lil Durk’s first daughter. The reason for her parents’ split was never officially revealed, but many believed that Covone, Bella’s mom, had had enough of Lil Durk’s philandering ways and proceeded to call off the relationship.</p><p>Regardless, they have maintained a cordial relationship for the sake of the celebrity child and her older brother.</p><h3><strong>Lil Durk’s Oldest Daughter Owns A Beauty Brand</strong></h3><p>Details of Bella’s formal educational background have yet to be revealed, but while she is still undoubtedly in the process of achieving academic exploits, Lil Durk’s oldest daughter is already a CEO, at least if the Instagram page @bellab_beauty_ is to be believed.</p><p>The beauty brand known as Bella Beauty is responsible for creating several beauty products ranging from lip glosses to face washes. The products are mainly for women. This entrepreneurial development has invariably meant that Bella knows what it means to be in the limelight, as evidenced by the more than 16.3k followers the aforementioned Instagram page has amassed.</p><p>Her non-work-related IG handle @queen_bella_banks_, where she posts family-related content like pictures of herself, her older brother, or her parents, has also attracted more than 100k followers, and this is despite her relatively young age.</p><p>All signs point to the fact that Bella Banks will be a force to be reckoned with in the world of fashion and show business when she eventually comes of age.</p><h2><strong>Meet Lil Durk’s Second Oldest Son, Zayden Banks</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> November 5, 2013</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 10 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li></ul><p>Zayden Banks was born in the United States on November 5, 2013, and is currently 10 years old. His birth sign is Scorpio, and he is predominantly of the African American ethnic group through his father, Lil Durk.</p><p>Technically, Zayden is the third child of the African American rapper, but he is also the singer’s second son. At the moment, though, not much is known about Zayden’s mother, including her name or what she may have looked like, given that a lot of women hang around Lil Durk because of his popularity.</p><p>We can attest that one of those women surely gave birth to Zayden. The accusations of infidelity leveled at Lil Durk when he was still with Nicole Covone make a lot of sense when one considers the fact that Zayden was born just a few months after his older half-sister Bella by another woman who is not Nicole.</p><h3><strong>Zayden Banks Is Also Active On Social Media</strong></h3><p>Like his older siblings, Zayden’s academic achievements have been overshadowed by his popularity as one of Lil Durk’s six children. Again, given his age, there is no doubt that he is still in school.</p><p>He is also not a stranger to the limelight because of how often he has been photographed with his famous dad and siblings. He is quite active on social media, particularly on Instagram, where his page @zayden_banks has accumulated more than 2.6k followers. However, the kind of content he posts on the page is unknown because the account is set to private.</p><h2><strong>Du’mier Banks Is Lil Durk’s Third Son</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 2014</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 10 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Possibly Deja Monét Trimble (Dej Loaf)</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li></ul><p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/DuMier-Banks.jpg alt width=700 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Du’mier Banks was born in 2014, but the exact date and month of his birth have yet to be revealed. He is Lil Durk’s fourth child and currently the youngest of the rapper’s three sons. Du’mier is approximately 10 years old and belongs primarily to the African American ethnic group.</p><p>Like his brother before him, there have been wild speculations about the identity of the woman responsible for bringing the celebrity child into this world, but the more common thread of evidence suggests that he may have been a product of his father’s relationship with Deja Monét Trimble.</p><p>None of those wild conjectures has been confirmed. Known and addressed as Dej Loaf to her fans and most of her colleagues, Du’mier’s alleged mom is an African American singer, rapper, and songwriter from Detroit, Michigan, United States, and the reason many believe she may be Du’mier’s mother is that his father, Lil Durk, dated the rapper for about two years from 2014 to 2016, right about the time the celebrity child was born.</p><p>Du’mier’s academic background remains shrouded in mystery, but he has been repeatedly exposed to the limelight through the social media activities of his father, which often features him and his other siblings.</p><h2><strong>Meet Skyler Banks, Lil Durk’s Second Daughter</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> August 29, 2014</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 9 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Tameka Kute</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li></ul><p>Skyler Banks was born on August 29, 2014, in the United States. Her birth sign is Virgo, and she is currently 9 years old. Skyler is Lil Durk’s fifth child overall, but she is also the rapper’s second daughter after Bella. She is one of the more real pieces of evidence of her father’s romantic relationship with his ex-partner, Tameka Kute.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/Skyler-Banks.jpg alt width=696 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Not much is known about her mother, though, nor the details of her relationship with Lil Durk. We can, however, confirm that the relationship between Skyler’s parents was anything but smooth and that her mother struggled with the same character issues that all the women before her had struggled with: Lil Durk’s inability to keep it in his pants.</p><p>They ultimately broke up, but Skyler has never been left without the love and care of either parent, especially that of her father, who constantly posts pictures of Skyler and her siblings across his social media pages.</p><p>Beyond being regularly featured on her father’s social media posts, the 9 year-old keeps a relatively low profile which includes the fact that she has no social media handles like some of her half-siblings and the fact that there are no verifiable details of her formal educational background.</p><h2><strong>Willow Banks Is Lil Durk’s Sixth Child</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> October 31, 2018</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 5 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> India Royale</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Student</li></ul><p>Willow Banks was born on October 31, 2018, in the United States. She is 5 years old, and her birth sign is Scorpio. Willow is the youngest of Lil Durk’s three daughters and also the youngest of the rapper’s six children.</p><p>She is the rapper’s child with long-term fianceé India Royale. Willow’s mom, born on March 9, 1995, is an Instagram influencer known for posting selfies and lifestyle photos on her @indiaroyale Instagram account, where she has amassed over 2.5 million followers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/Willow-Banks.png alt width=696 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Willow’s parents began dating in 2017, and after her mom became pregnant with her, her father asked her to marry him during a hometown performance at&nbsp; United Center, Chicago, in September 2018, just about a month before she was born.</p><p>Willow’s life in the spotlight has been orchestrated by both of her parents, who have massive followings across several social media platforms. However, her formal educational progression is not one of the things they often post about.</p><h2><strong>Lil Durk Is Potentially A Father To Seven Kids</strong></h2><p>Lil Durk only has six kids, but the number could increase in the future. The rapper is still engaged to India Royale, and if the couple eventually decides to follow through on their engagement which has lasted for around half a decade now, Lil Durk could become a father to India Royale’s daughter from a previous relationship which will invariably bring the number of the rapper’s children up to seven.</p><p>Furthermore, India Royale has revealed Lil Durk’s expressed desire to father more kids with her, preferably a son since they already have a daughter together, a desire that would bring the rapper closer to achieving his goal of fathering ten kids, and one she is down with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLmquIydrKujXZ7Abq2Mn5itoJWnerCyjKygsWWTnbatsNGepWaeoqS6brDIn52eqpWjwW7Dzqacp2WdmrK1edOhnKZn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flil-durk-is-a-father-of-six-children-from-different-women.html&text=Lil%20Durk%20is%20a%20Father%20of%20Six%20Children%20From%20Different%20Women&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flil-durk-is-a-father-of-six-children-from-different-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flil-durk-is-a-father-of-six-children-from-different-women.html&title=Lil%20Durk%20is%20a%20Father%20of%20Six%20Children%20From%20Different%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flil-durk-is-a-father-of-six-children-from-different-women.html&title=Lil%20Durk%20is%20a%20Father%20of%20Six%20Children%20From%20Different%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flil-durk-is-a-father-of-six-children-from-different-women.html&title=Lil%20Durk%20is%20a%20Father%20of%20Six%20Children%20From%20Different%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flil-durk-is-a-father-of-six-children-from-different-women.html&description=Lil%20Durk%20is%20a%20Father%20of%20Six%20Children%20From%20Different%20Women" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./verified-15-off-noracora-active-coupon-codes-for-december-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Verified 15% Off | Noracora active coupon codes for December 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./israel-kamakawiwo%CA%BBole.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Israel Kamakawiwoole">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
