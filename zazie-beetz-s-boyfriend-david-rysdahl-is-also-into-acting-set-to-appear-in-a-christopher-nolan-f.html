And going by Beetz's social media, the actor has made his girlfriend proud.</p><p class=dh>German-American actress Zazie Beetz has made her mark in numerous mainstream movies. She recently dazzled the audience with her acting chops in the 2022-action comedy "Bullet Train." But it's not just her career that attracts people's attention; it is also her personal life, including her longtime boyfriend.</p><p class=dh>David Rysdahl is an American actor, writer, and producer. The "Deadpool 2" actress took to social media to support his recent "No Exit" film on March 4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/36309d44ee0a427a539a4fb2322f33d3.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rysdahl at the Sundance Film Festival, 2018 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Zazie Beetz's Boyfriend grew up in New Ulm</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Rysdahl grew up in the countryside of New Ulm, Minnesota, in a very religious family. Although he does not share the same relationship with religion anymore, his faith-based teachings taught him to be empathetic.</p><p class=dh>In an interview with Visual Tales Magazine, Rysdahl <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://visualtalesmagazine.com/2022/02/25/david-rysdahl/>said</a> that he emulated Jesus, wanting to champion the poor and the ignored. He has three siblings, Gabriel, Issac, and Kaye, who was homeschooled. Creativity seemed to be in the family, as one of his siblings is now <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/zazie-beetz-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-facts-deadpool/>a budding filmmaker</a>.</p><p class=dh>Post the initial years of homeschooling, Rysdahl joined a physical school in seventh grade and eventually graduated from New Ulm Cathedral Highschool. He pursued higher education at St. Olaf's College.</p><p class=dh>He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/ny-david-rysdahl-no-exit-new-york-20220222-bhah5w5ilvfdxcric66xzohbyq-story.html>gained a deep interest</a> in acting when he starred as Laertes in the play "Hamlet" at the Great River Shakespeare Festival in Minnesota, which he happened to enjoy thoroughly. It is there that one of the actors suggested to Rysdahl that he move to New York.</p><p class=dh>Rysdahl was a big fan of Bob Dylan, who also grew up in Minnesota and moved to New York. Curious to explore new prospects, Rysdahl moved to New York in 2009.</p><p class=dh>After graduating college, he moved to Los Angeles and began working on projects such as "That's Not Us" and "Black Swell."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>David Rysdahl will soon appear in a Christopher Nolan film</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Rysdahl has acted in several movies, including "Dead Pigs," "Shelter," and "The Revival." He also stars in the upcoming Netflix original movie "The Family."</p><p class=dh>The actor is also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oppenheimer-casts-david-rysdahl-1235104019/>set to be a part</a> of Christopher Nolan's ambitious project "Oppenheimer." The movie is slated for release in 2023 and is currently in post-production.</p><p class=dh>However, Rysdahl's role has remained a secret in this biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned theoretical physicist who led the team that developed the first atomic bombs during WWII.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/858b1e3199d640310b9207a7fffc5b35.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rysdahl at The IMdB Studio, 2020 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The 35-year-old has featured in many short films since the beginning of his onscreen career, including the more recent "The Ghost of Hank Williams" in 2019 and the 2020 short film "Repo." Rysdahl enjoys short films just like short stories and believes making them is difficult.</p><p class=dh>The actor has previously spoken about his love for the short film format, stating that it calls for a more efficient way of conveying a story. He wrote the 2016-short film "Black Swell," a story about a man contemplating suicide in a motel room, through which Rysdahl wanted to experiment with perspective within a confined space.</p><p class=dh>Rysdahl enjoys exploring scenarios one cannot experience in real life while writing or acting. Be it the suicidal man in "Black Swell" or a man stuck in a snowstorm with a kidnapped child in "No Exit."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0610720d0fea8e620c044fae6a2eece0.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rysdahl at VIP screening of "No Exit" | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He internalizes the character by talking about it as if it was him and starts with the story's premise. He likes to immerse his fictional character into an imaginary circumstance and let it play out in his mind first. This process allows his subconscious to empathize with the character more.</p><p class=dh>Over the years, Rysdahl made an effort to draw a hard line between his life and the character he portrays. He believes that this method helps him go deeper into character.</p><p class=dh>The release of the film "Oppenheimer" is one of Rysdahl's next big projects, where he will appear alongside stars like Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Zazie Beetz's relationship with her boyfriend</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Many actor-couples prefer keeping their work and personal lives separate. But Beetz and Rysdahl have done the opposite successfully, although it did take a while to get there.</p><p class=dh>Rysdahl revealed <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/zazie-beetz-boyfriend>it took them three years</a> to be comfortable working together. He and Beetz shared the screen in the 2020 film "Nine Days." However, they are wary of not compromising the script to work together. Speaking about their work equation, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://visualtalesmagazine.com/2022/02/25/david-rysdahl/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"When choosing projects to work on together, we always want to make sure we are both right for the role."</p><p class=dh>Rydahl revealed that there are times when a script that Beetz brings him may not feel right to him, and in those scenarios, there is no pressure for him to take up the role anyway.</p><p class=dh>One thing that Rysdahl and Beetz have in common professionally is their liking for roles that explore human life in its different dimensions. Like Rysdahl, Beetz, who starred alongside Ryan Reynolds in the blockbuster <a class="me a" href=#>"Deadpool 2"</a> is drawn to stories that view the world from someone else's perspective.</p><p class=dh>Recently, the couple has also been working together on avenues apart from films, including being judges for the "72 Hour Film Slam" contest for filmmakers.</p><p class=dh>Although Beetz and Rysdahl haven't hidden her romantic life from the public, their exact relationship status is unclear. The couple first met during an acting workshop in 2014 and have since been together.</p><p class=dh>In the interview published by Visual Tales, the interviewer mentioned Beetz as Rysdahl's wife. Rysdahl didn't correct it and continued answering the questions. On the other hand, some sources say that the duo is engaged.</p><p class=dh>With a shared eye for stories that stand out, Rysdahl and Beetz continue to feature in exciting projects in their careers. The actors have come a long way, and though it is unknown where they stand in their relationship, their support for each other is no secret.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbmloa3q7rdminGaalZrBu7%2BMm6aynqKesq%2BwjJ2Yr6GUYr%2B6v8Oan6Vlmah7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzazie-beetz-s-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-is-also-into-acting-set-to-appear-in-a-christopher-nolan-f.html&text=Zazie%20Beetzs%20Boyfriend%20David%20Rysdahl%20Is%20Also%20into%20Acting%20%26amp%3b%20Set%20to%20Appear%20in%20a%20Christopher%20Nolan%20F&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzazie-beetz-s-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-is-also-into-acting-set-to-appear-in-a-christopher-nolan-f.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzazie-beetz-s-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-is-also-into-acting-set-to-appear-in-a-christopher-nolan-f.html&title=Zazie%20Beetzs%20Boyfriend%20David%20Rysdahl%20Is%20Also%20into%20Acting%20%26amp%3b%20Set%20to%20Appear%20in%20a%20Christopher%20Nolan%20F" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzazie-beetz-s-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-is-also-into-acting-set-to-appear-in-a-christopher-nolan-f.html&title=Zazie%20Beetzs%20Boyfriend%20David%20Rysdahl%20Is%20Also%20into%20Acting%20%26amp%3b%20Set%20to%20Appear%20in%20a%20Christopher%20Nolan%20F" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzazie-beetz-s-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-is-also-into-acting-set-to-appear-in-a-christopher-nolan-f.html&title=Zazie%20Beetzs%20Boyfriend%20David%20Rysdahl%20Is%20Also%20into%20Acting%20%26amp%3b%20Set%20to%20Appear%20in%20a%20Christopher%20Nolan%20F" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzazie-beetz-s-boyfriend-david-rysdahl-is-also-into-acting-set-to-appear-in-a-christopher-nolan-f.html&description=Zazie%20Beetzs%20Boyfriend%20David%20Rysdahl%20Is%20Also%20into%20Acting%20%26amp%3b%20Set%20to%20Appear%20in%20a%20Christopher%20Nolan%20F" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charlie-montoyo-wife-who-is-samantha-montoyo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlie Montoyo Wife: Who Is Samantha Montoyo?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./two-nfl-wide-receivers-are-betting-their-luxury-cars-on-who-will-have-a-better-season.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Two NFL Wide Receivers Are Betting Their Luxury Cars On Who Will Have A Better Season">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
