Chelsea Clinton has a net worth of $30 million. That is a combined net worth with her husband Marc Mezvinsky who is a partner at the private equity behemoth TPG.

In 1993, her father was elected the 42nd President of the United States and the family moved to Washington, D.C. where Chelsea attended Sidwell Friends School. In 1997, she was a National Merit Scholarship semifinalist. She graduated from high school that same year. Her father was the graduation speaker for her class. During his address, Bill Clinton said: "A part of us longs to hold you once more." Sidwell Friends School is largely considered to be the "Harvard of Washington D.C.'s private schools." Sasha and <a href=# title="Malia Obama Net Worth">Malia Obama</a> also attended Sidwell.</p><p>Clinton went to college at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.
