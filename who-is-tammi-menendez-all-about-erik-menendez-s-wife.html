She promptly felt sorry for both, and out of empathy, she wrote a letter to Erik. One of her interviews states that she never expected a reply from him. But he wrote back, and their love life started from there.</p><p>Well! Erik and Tammi never met until 1997, when she traveled to Folsom from California to meet him.

In their trials, both mentioned that they killed them in self-defense. They also nodded that Jose Menendez was sexually abusive and would kill them if they didn’t kill him to protect their lives. However, the court never believed their story.</p><p>In 1996, both Erik and Lyle were found guilty and received a life sentence for the attempted double murder of their parents. First, the brothers spent more than 20 years executing their sentences separately. But in 2018, they were reunited at the California Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility.</p><p></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-erik-menendezs-daughter-taliya-menendez></span>How old is Erik Menendez’s daughter (Taliya Menendez)?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Menendez’s daughter Talia Menendez is the stepdaughter of Erik but she calls him her earthly father.

Erik Menendez, daughter is around twenty-three or twenty-four as of 2024.</p><p>Talia lives with her mother mainly, they both travel 150 miles every weekend to meet Erik. Talia also handles her father’s Instagram account and resides in California along with her mother.</p><p><strong>Summing Up:</strong></p><p>Tammi was a charming entrepreneur when she met Erik. Both intend to make their odd married life work because the jail forbids it. Regardless, they are both content with their ongoing emotional connection to one another.
